#This program demonstrates the use of variables
#Variables can be used to store data of many types

v = 1 #This variable is an integer
print("The value of v is now", v)
v = v + 1 #This modifies the value of the variable

print("V is now", v) #What will this output?

x = 0.5 #This variable is a "float" 
x = x + 45
print("The value of x is now", x) 

#To multiply x by 5, and store that in another variable, you would write...

y = x * 5
